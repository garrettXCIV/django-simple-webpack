[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"

# Ignored:
#
# invalid-name (C0103):           A name doesn't doesn't fit the naming
#                                     convention for a constant/variable/class.
# missing-docstring (C0111):      A module, function, class or method has no
#                                     docstring. Some special methods like
#                                     __init__() don't require a docstring and
#                                     for those, this message is not raised if
#                                     they have no docstring.
# too-few-public-methods (R0903): Classes aren't meant to just store data,
#                                     i.e., as a dictionary.
#
# Unused:
#
# bad-continuation (C0330):       The next line is indented incorrectly.
# bad-option-value (E0012):       A bad value for a PyLint option was
#                                     encountered.
# fixme (W0511):                  FIXME or XXX found in comment.
# no-self-use (R0201):            Member function never uses 'self' parameter.
# star-args (W0142):              A function or method was called using *args
#                                     or **kwargs to dispatch arguments.
# locally-disabled (I0011):       Notes local suppression of warning.
